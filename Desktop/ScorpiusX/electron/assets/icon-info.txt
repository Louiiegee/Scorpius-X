WINDOWS ICON REQUIREMENTS FOR SCORPIUS CYBERSECURITY DASHBOARD
================================================================

For proper Windows deployment, you need to create these icon files:

1. icon.ico - Main application icon (256x256, 128x128, 64x64, 48x48, 32x32, 16x16)
   - Use a cybersecurity/shield theme with dark colors
   - Should match the Scorpius brand (teal/cyan accents on black)
   - Multi-resolution ICO file for Windows

2. installer-header.bmp - Installer header image (150x57 pixels)
   - Horizontal banner for NSIS installer header
   - Should contain Scorpius logo and cybersecurity theme

3. installer-wizard.bmp - Installer wizard image (164x314 pixels)
   - Vertical banner for installer welcome/finish pages
   - Dark theme with Scorpius branding

RECOMMENDED DESIGN:
- Primary color: #000000 (black background)
- Accent color: #00ffff (cyan/teal)
- Secondary: #0066cc (blue accents)
- Font: Modern, technical font for any text
- Theme: Cybersecurity, shield, lock, or circuit patterns

TOOLS TO CREATE ICONS:
- Online: favicon.io, iconarchive.com
- Desktop: GIMP, Photoshop, Inkscape
- Automated: electron-icon-builder

TEMPORARY PLACEHOLDER:
Until real icons are created, the app will use default Electron icons.
The build process will work without custom icons but will look more professional with them.

TO ADD ICONS:
1. Save icon.ico in this folder (electron/assets/)
2. Save installer graphics in this folder
3. Run: npm run electron-build-win-installer
