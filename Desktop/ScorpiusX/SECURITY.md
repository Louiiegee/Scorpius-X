## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Scorpius Security team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@scorpius.io**

Include the following information in your report:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths** of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- **Location** of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact** of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Confirmation**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Timeline**: Varies based on severity
  - **Critical**: 1-7 days
  - **High**: 7-30 days
  - **Medium**: 30-90 days
  - **Low**: 90+ days

### Vulnerability Assessment

We use the following severity levels:

#### Critical

- Remote code execution
- SQL injection with data access
- Authentication bypass
- Sensitive data exposure

#### High

- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Path traversal
- Insecure direct object references

#### Medium

- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Weak cryptography
- Session management issues

#### Low

- Security misconfigurations
- Missing security headers
- Weak password policies

### Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you:

- **Allow us time** to investigate and fix the issue before public disclosure
- **Avoid accessing** or modifying user data
- **Do not perform** destructive testing
- **Keep information** about the vulnerability confidential until we've had a chance to address it

### Security Measures

Our application implements multiple security layers:

#### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Session timeout and management

#### Data Protection

- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Encryption at rest for sensitive data
- Input validation and sanitization
- Output encoding

#### Infrastructure Security

- Container security scanning
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secure CI/CD pipeline
- Regular security audits

#### Application Security

- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Error handling without information disclosure

### Security Features

#### Built-in Security Controls

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Authentication**: Secure JWT implementation with refresh tokens
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **HTTPS Only**: All communications encrypted in transit
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers implemented
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and DDoS attacks

#### Security Testing

- **Static Analysis**: ESLint security rules and SonarQube
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
- **Container Scanning**: Docker image security analysis
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular third-party security assessments
